Hi, I’m Lauren.

This site is a portfolio, a project hub, and a running log of my roller coaster travels and theme park adventures. Most of the writing here revolves around coaster trips, park observations, and QueueQuest, a project that ties it all together.

If you want a starting point, read Hello World.
