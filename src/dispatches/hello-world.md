description: The obligatory first post explaining what this space is for.

Every site needs a starting point. This is mine.

I've had some version of a portfolio site for years, but it's always been... functional. A place to list credentials, link to LinkedIn, maybe showcase a project or two. Useful, but not *personal*.

This time I wanted something different. Somewhere I could write about projects while I'm building them, share thoughts on the tools I'm learning, and occasionally ramble about roller coasters or travel hacks.

## What to expect

**Project updates** - I'll write about what I'm building, what's working, and (more interestingly) what isn't.

**Tech thoughts** - Tools, frameworks, and approaches I'm exploring. QA perspective on development practices.

**Everything else** - Theme parks, travel, cocktails, and whatever else seems worth documenting.

## The format

These dispatches won't follow a schedule. They'll show up when I have something worth saying. Could be twice a week, could be twice a month.

If that sounds interesting, welcome. If not, the [portfolio](/work/) and [projects](/projects/) are right over there.

Let's see where this goes.
